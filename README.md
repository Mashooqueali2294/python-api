Hi, I'm Mashooque Ali

I'm an API Developer passionate about building reliable, scalable, and secure backend systems using FastAPI, SQLModel, and PostgreSQL.  

For the past 2 months, I've been deeply focused on mastering API development â€” not just learning syntax, but understanding how to solve real business problems with clean and efficient code.  

If you ever need help designing or developing a custom API for your product or business,  
you can find me on Upwork or other freelance platforms.
